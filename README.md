## Task 2: Clustering

### Introduction to the Dataset
The dataset includes key water quality parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and turbidity. These metrics are essential indicators of water conditions that impact aquatic life diversity and abundance.

### Objective
This project aims to analyze water quality data to identify clusters of aquatic life based on key water quality metrics. Understanding these clusters helps uncover patterns that affect aquatic ecosystems.

### Result
- Comparison of clustering performance between K-Means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering using Silhouette Scores.
- Visualizations (e.g., scatter plots or dendrograms) to illustrate the formed groups.
- Recommendation of the clustering method with the highest Silhouette Score as the final model.
